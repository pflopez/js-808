# JS-808

Kept on going with the drum machine. Added basic playblack with howler, velocity settings, and
a pseudo po-12 layout for phones.


# Installation

This is a basic angular 5 app done with angular-cli.
Cloning the project and doing an `npm install` after should get you going.
`ng serve` to run.




## TODOS

- Save the patterns, using local storage for example. Probably needs a UI element to save explicitly.
- Parametrize the color scheme so we can change basically the main color and the highlight color.
- Keep polishing the "phone" version.
- More tests? Always more tests.
